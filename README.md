# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA

As part of a value-added course with UNP Education, I utilized Power BI to analyze a company's financial dataset. My analysis uncovered key insights into sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, discount impacts, and product performance. The findings highlight a 249.46% profit growth, regional profit margin variations, and the influence of high and low-margin products. Based on these insights, I provided strategic recommendations to enhance pricing, discount strategies, inventory management, and sales expansion for sustainable business growth.
