# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA


As part of our Value-Added Course with UNP Education, we conducted a financial analysis using Power BI to extract meaningful business insights. The study focused on key metrics such as sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, the impact of discounts, and product performance. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s analytical and visualization capabilities, we identified critical patterns and provided data-driven recommendations to enhance business operations.

Key Insights & Findings:

Achieved a 249.46% profit increase, influenced by higher sales, pricing adjustments, and changes in demand.

Identified regional profit margin variations, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to improve profitability.

Examined the effects of discounts, revealing that while they boosted sales, excessive discounting on certain products reduced overall profitability.

Assessed product margins, showing that some low-margin products, despite high sales volume, negatively impacted profits, whereas high-margin products played a crucial role in business growth.

Strategic Recommendations:
Optimize pricing strategies through dynamic and value-based pricing models.

Develop a structured discounting framework to balance sales growth and profit margins effectively.

Improve inventory management using demand forecasting techniques to prevent stock imbalances.

Expand sales efforts in high-growth regions to maximize revenue opportunities.

This analysis demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making with Power BI, offering actionable insights to drive long-term financial and operational success.
